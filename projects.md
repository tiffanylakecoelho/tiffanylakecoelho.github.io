# Projects

Following is a description of technical projects I have conducted or contributed to since 2021. Repositories for these projects can be found on [my Github](https://github.com/tiffanylakecoelho).

## PicoCraft
Studied and implemented 2D Perlin noise for a top-down, town-building game in PICO-8. Challenged the limitations of the PICO-8 engine by implementing a theoretically infinite world.

## Build-a-Cache
Collaborated in a group of three to write a C program that simulates the behavior of a cache. Evaluated the impact of cache size,  associativity, and block size on cache performance for different cache confgurations and coherence protocols.

## RISC-V Processor
Implemented a single-cycle processor from scratch using Logisim. Supported arithmetic, logic, and memory operations. Designed a test file and a small byte reversal program—both in RISC-V—to ensure the processor's correctness.

## Robot Meta-Language (RML) Interpreter
Created an evaluator for a non-trivial programming language with OCaml and Visual Studio Code. Designed abstract syntax trees to support constants, basic operations, functions, data types, sequences, references, and asynchronous expressions.

## Adventure Augmented
Developed a text adventure game engine, complete with a win/lose condition, the ability to collect items, and two sample 
adventures. Programmed using OCaml and Visual Studio Code.

## Simulating Evolving Artificial Life
Collaborated in a group of three to simulate a world of animals (“critters”) that wander, eat food, reproduce, and evolve. Built a graphical visualization enabling users to control the critters. Implemented fault injection to mutate each critter's genome—a program determining their behavior—through reproduction. Developed an interpreter and simulator to evaluate and execute the genome.
