## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="careerheadshot.jpg">

I'm an honors student at Fairleigh Dickinson University, where I'm studying Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity and a minor in Mathematics.

I started my undergraduate at Cornell University, where I was recognized as a [Meinig Family Cornell National Scholar](https://scl.cornell.edu/get-involved/cornell-commitment/meinig-family-cornell-national-scholars/membership). I'm continuing my degree at FDU, where I'm an active member of their [Honors Program](https://www.fdu.edu/academics/honors/university-honors-program/) and maintain a 4.0 GPA. I'm currently conducting CAHSI research in Cybersecurity & Machine Learning with Professor [Neelu Sinha](https://www.fdu.edu/profiles/neelu_sinha/). My honors thesis project in Cybersecurity is being mentored by Professor [Ihab Darwish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ihab-darwish-phd-pmp-a2b305b/). In my free time, I have been studying for the Security+ Exam which I will be taking during spring break of 2024.

 I am pursuing an internship in the Cybersecurity industry for the Summer of 2024. I'm open to work and am always welcoming new connections!

## Activities

ðŸ”¬ <b>CAHSI Local Research</b>   
I'm currently conducting mentored research as part of the CAHSI Local REU program, and engaging in training to strengthen my computing, communication, and professional skills. I'm creating a research plan, maintaining a journal to report on research progress, and creating a research poster to disseminate my research results.   
   
ðŸŽ² <b>Founder of FDU Game Dev</b>   
Within my first semester at Fairleigh Dickinson, I founded FDU Game Dev, a club where students of any discipline can explore the creation of games and collaborate to make a game of our own. As President, I leverage my expertise in leadership and game development to guide the Executive Board, strategically plan weekly meeting agendas, and provide hands-on support to members throughout the game creation process. Through this initiative, I demonstrate my ability to effectively lead teams, cultivate a supportive community, and translate creative visions into tangible projects within the span of a semester.
