## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="careerheadshot.jpg">

I'm an honors student at Fairleigh Dickinson University, where I'm studying Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity and a minor in Mathematics.

I started my undergraduate at Cornell University, where I was recognized as a [Meinig Family Cornell National Scholar](https://scl.cornell.edu/get-involved/cornell-commitment/meinig-family-cornell-national-scholars/membership). I'm continuing my degree at FDU, where I'm an active member of their [Honors Program](https://www.fdu.edu/academics/honors/university-honors-program/) and maintain a 4.0 GPA. I'm currently conducting research in Artificial Intelligance & Machine Learning with Professor [Neelu Sinha](https://www.fdu.edu/profiles/neelu_sinha/).

 I am pursuing an internship in the Cybersecurity industry for the Summer of 2024. I'm open to work and am always welcoming new connections!
